## About

This is a space navigator. It determines the distance, speed and direction of an object. These are stars, galaxies and asteroids. Estimates the speed of an object, whether it is dangerous or not if it flies in your direction. It also evaluates the path on which to fly, as quickly and reliably as possible. All this is done by AI. Data taken from open sources.
